# The C-Script Library (CppS)

> _TypeScript ergonomics. C++ power._

### ‚öñÔ∏è The STL optimizes for compilers. C-Script optimizes for developers.

#### **Contrasting Priorities**

The STL has served the C++ community well ‚Äî and C++ is a better language because of it.  
But while the STL is built with compilers in mind, **C-Script** is built with developers in mind.

#### **Introducing C-Script**

The C-Script Library offers ergonomic alternatives to several STL ADTs,  
**while maintaining seamless interoperability with the STL.**  
You can drop CPPS objects into legacy code without friction, by design.

This reflects C-Script‚Äôs core philosophy: **"Usability is Utility".**

C-Script isn‚Äôt here to replace the STL ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to complement it by prioritizing developer experience where the STL prioritizes performance and generality.

### üîß C++ doesn‚Äôt need training wheels. It needs just better handlebars.

#### **TypeScript-Inspired APIs in C++**

The C-Script Library brings TypeScript-inspired ergonomics to C++, with sleek APIs and a priority for developer experience (DX).
It features a header-only suite of ADTs and a lightweight, reimagined String class, all drop-in compatible with legacy STL code.

This compact library offers:

- A **header-only suite** of templated ADTs for zero-hassle integration
- A **featherlight `String` class**, reimagined for both utility and comfort  
  _(powered by the library‚Äôs single compiled `.cpp` file)_

The result is a fluent modern suite that feels natural and powerful without ditching the C++ philosophy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use C-Script

C-Script is made up of a set of mostly-independent modules. All features live under the `cpps` namespace (short for **C++ Script**).

Just `#include` and go. No macros, no weird build steps, and no ceremony.

> #### Pronunciation Note
>
> _For the curious, `cpps` is pronounced "sips".
> <br>
> Yes, you \_could_ call it C-P-P-S, but that's like choosing S-Q-L over sequel.
>
> Don't do that yourself, _please._

## Classes

**Array**

- In TypeScript fashion, this is actually a vector... "Array" just rolls off the tongue better.  
  _Yes, I know it‚Äôs not technically an array. But TypeScript didn't care ‚Äî and neither do most devs._

**Queues**

- Four styles included:
  - Restricted-input queue (default)
  - Classic quque (FIFO, theoretical moedel most people think of)
  - Deque (double-ended)
  - Restricted-output queue (yeah, it‚Äôs weird)

**Stack**

- Like a TS Array, `Array` supports several stack methods...
  - But reducing a cornerstone data structure to a couple of members in another class feels wrong.
- Also, blending Stack and Array creates a messy interface and violates ISP like crazy.  
  (Why does a stack have iteration and random access?? It shouldn‚Äôt.)

**String**

- This library doesn‚Äôt reinvent `std::string`.
- It just adds convenient string utilities _atop_ `std::string`.

Plus: since the library is header-only and super tight, it‚Äôs totally reasonable to use `namespace cpps` in your project as well.  
(Because who‚Äôs still writing `using namespace std` in 2025?)

## Future Data Structures

The following have been identified as possible additions to the library in future versions.

| **Class**        | **Why Not Support This Type Now?**                                                                                                                                               | Likelihood of Future Support |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| FixedArray<N,T\> | **_const Array<T\>_** should be pretty sufficient for many cases, so it need not be a priority to write a dedicated **_FixedAray</T>_** right now.                               | high                         |
| Map<Key,Value\>  | I've got to crawl before I ball. I think this should definitely wait until I've gotten all my ducks in a row with development, testing, and docs for the main 4 class categories | high                         |
